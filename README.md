About App
---
Our app basically modernises the way a traffic policeman inspects the document of a driver and/or vehicle. Time is the most precious commodity in today’s world and we don’t want that anybody should waste our’s, but what if the traffic policeman standing on the road for the sake of our security and safety, stop your vehicle and ask you to let him inspect your documents, then we think of a way by which we could just pass that quickly and continue our ride and what if there is a way by which that process can be completed in just a couple of seconds, our app provides you the way by which you can just complete the process of document inspection by the policeman by just clicking few button on your android or iOS phone. 
Ddrive is extremely secure file storage app because it uses firebase for its storage and authentication purposes.
